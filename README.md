## Neuromatch 2021 Deep Learning Project:

<em>The Phenomenon</em>: Stimuli (movie scenes, naturalistic, music etc) evoke attention and potentially similar brain activity across viewers.

<em>The Data</em>:
 - [Study Forrest Movie Transcript](https://f1000research.com/articles/10-54/v1)
 - [Study Forrest Eye Gaze and Neuroimaging](http://www.studyforrest.org/data.html)
 - [Human Connectome Project Neuroimaging + Story Q/A](https://www.humanconnectome.org/storage/app/media/documentation/s1200/HCP_S1200_Release_Reference_Manual.pdf)

<em>The Question</em>: Can audience preference be linked to reliable neural representations of stimuli (scenes, naturalistic, music etc). Do more preferred/attention grabbing stimuli produce shared neural signals among audiences. In other words, can we predict sentiments (plus attention) based on the fMRI functional connectivity metric?

<em>Approach & Goal</em> To predict sentiments from functional connectivity in the brain. Use NLP derived sentiment metrics for audience preference!??! (Eye gaze/fixation/saccade for attention too!) And see if shared preferences evoke shared brain patterns. 

<em>Neuroscience</em>: Can we use BOLD fMRI functional connectivity matrix to predict sentiments or stimuli features? Or the other way around?
